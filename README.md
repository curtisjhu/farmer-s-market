# farmer-s-market
Small Public Pinboard for the farmers.

This was a 1 day project. I learned Ruby + Rails from scratch. 

Frontend: Next.js + tailwindcss -> vercel
Backend: RubyOnRails + MongoDB -> digital ocean docker container

Not much security is in play here. I'm on the free tier so it doesn't matter that much. 
Please don't DDoS the backend endpoints. I won't get charged over 5 bucks but I still would prefer my website working.
